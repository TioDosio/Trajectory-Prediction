## Technical Approach

### Trajectory Prediction Pipeline

1. **Data Acquisition**: Receives human pose data from Vizzy robot's perception system via ROS messages
2. **State Estimation**: Uses Extended Kalman Filter to estimate current position, velocity, and orientation
3. **Motion Modeling**: Implements constant velocity and constant angular velocity motion models
4. **Prediction**: Projects future trajectory based on current state estimate and motion dynamics
5. **Visualization**: Real-time display of tracked skeleton and predicted trajectory

### State Representation

The system tracks the following state variables:

- **Body Position**: 2D position (x, y) on the ground plane
- **Body Velocity**: 2D velocity vector (vx, vy)
- **Head Orientation**: 3D orientation quaternion for head pose
- **Angular Velocity**: Rotational velocity of head orientation

### Kalman Filter Implementation

- **Process Model**: Constant velocity motion model with acceleration noise
- **Measurement Model**: Direct observation of body keypoints and head pose
- **Noise Handling**: Adaptive noise parameters based on keypoint confidence scores
- **State Prediction**: Multi-step ahead trajectory prediction capabilities
